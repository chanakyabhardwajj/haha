# haha
A simple android app that displays latest jokes from Reddit.

WARNING:
This app simply displays the top-most jokes from the "jokes" & "meanjokes" subreddits.
The jokes may be extremely offensive. Reddit's API does not provide any filtering mechanism.
The "over_18" flag is rarely used. DO NOT INSTALL if you don't appreciate such humor.
